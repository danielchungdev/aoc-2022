# Advent of Code 2022

## Lessons Learned
- `set` in python is really powerfull. Functions like `.intersect()`, `.union()` and `.difference()` are really powerful in comparing. They save a lot of time when you want to know what in the sets are repeated. Also `.issubset()` and `.issuperset`. 

- One liners to create arrays are really helpful and speed you up a ton. `[x for x in range(n, m)]`
